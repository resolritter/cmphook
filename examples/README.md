# Examples

The examples show a "Tick Tock" application which basically works like this:

- The parent hosts the tick and tock states
- When the tick state is updated, only the "Tick" children are updated
- When the tock state is updated, only the "Tock" children are updated

The `mithril` and `react` folders contain examples of `cmphook` integrated to
the libraries which those folders are named after. Each directory provides
instructions for running the example in their README file.
